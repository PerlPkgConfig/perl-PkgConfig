PkgConfig

This module is a pure perl version of pkg-config, a program
that provides compiler and linker flags for installed packages.
See:

http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/

for the original.  The POD for the module contains a more detailed
description of how it works and the differences from the original.
You can view it before installing using perldoc:

 % perldoc lib/PkgConfig.pm

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may change the scripts that get installed by using the --script
option one or more times.  For example, if you prefer not to install
pkg-config.pl you could do this:

 % perl Makefile.PL --script=ppkg-config

Or if you want to use ppkg-config and pkg-config (say you are on a
platform that  does not provide it):

 % perl Makefile.PL --script=pkg-config --script=ppkg-config

Or if you don't want any scripts installed at all:

 % perl Makefile.PL --script=none

The default is "--script=ppkg-config --script=pkg-config.pl" except for
Windows, where the default is just "--script=ppkg-config".

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
